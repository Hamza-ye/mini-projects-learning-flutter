# Example – ‘http_employees’

From Learn Google Flutter Fast 65 Example Apps book by Mark Clow.

## Getting Started

We start off by creating a create basic app with Stateful and Stateless Widgets.
Later on, we add some state & event handling so that the user can select a car and see it highlighted.
* The car selection comes from a tap event in the lower-level CarWidget. 
* It changes the selected car state in the higher-level MyHomePageWidget.
