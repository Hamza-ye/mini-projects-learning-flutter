# Example – ‘http_employees’

From Learn Google Flutter Fast 65 Example Apps book by Mark Clow.

## Getting Started

This example app connects to dummy Api and enables you to add employees, update employees and delete them. It starts with a list of employees and you can tap on one to view and make changes. You can also delete employees but tapping longer on an employee in the list of employees.
This example app should also demonstrate how you may sometimes encounter errors when communicating with Apis. For example, the dummy Api doesn’t allow the same employee name twice. If you enter the same employee name twice and attempt to save, then the dummy Api will return an error and this is displayed to the user. This could be handled more gracefully but at least it catches it and shows some information at the bottom.
